# Payconiq - Stock Management (Code Challenge)

### Source code and environment prerequisites:

This application is developed and compiled using Java 17.0.1 LTS version and for successful compilation of the program
would require Java 17 or later version. Although, haven't used any experimental feature newly introduced with Java 17.

A Dockerfile is available with basic configuration to run the application on docker engine without any configuration as 
well.

### Unit and integration tests:

Service endpoints required to cater the main requirement of the application scenarios are covered with the unit tests.
